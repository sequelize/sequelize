var User = sequelize.define('User', {/* ... */})
var Project = sequelize.define('Project', {/* ... */})

// OK. Now things get more complicated (not really visible to the user :)).
// First let's define a hasMany association
Project.hasMany('Workers', User, {as: 'Workers'})

/*
  This will add the attribute ProjectId or project_id to User.
  Instances of Project will get the accessors getWorkers and setWorkers.
  
  We could just leave it the way it is and let it be a one-way association.
  But we want more! Let's define the other way around:
*/

User.hasMany('Projects', Project)

/*
  This will remove the attribute ProjectId (or project_id) from User and create
  a new model called ProjectsUsers with the equivalent foreign keys ProjectId
  (or project_id) and UserId (or user_id). If the attributes are camelcase or
  not depends on the Model it represents.
  
  Now you can use Project#getWorkers, Project#setWorkers, User#getTasks and
  User#setTasks.
