Sequelize is an easy-to-use and promise-based [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) [ORM tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) for [Postgres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL), [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL), [MariaDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MariaDB), [SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite), [DB2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Db2_Family), [Microsoft SQL Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server), and [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/). It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.
