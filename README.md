`sequelize-snowflake` is a fork of the Sequelize ORM for nodejs. The purpose of this project is to add support for Snowflake ❄️ and merge back upstream.

Sequelize is a promise-based [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) [ORM tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) for [Postgres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL), [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL), [MariaDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MariaDB), [SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite) and [Microsoft SQL Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server). It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.

Sequelize follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) and supports Node v10 and above.

## Note: Looking for maintainers!

Recently, a bigger part of the former core maintainers (thanks to all your hard work!) have been rather busy. Hence, the available time to look after our beloved ORM has been shrinking and shrinking drastically, generating a great chance for you:

We are looking for more core maintainers who are interested in improving/fixing our TypeScript typings, improving the documentation, organizing issues, reviewing PRs, streamlining the overall code base and planning the future roadmap.
