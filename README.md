Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, read replication and more.

[Stable (v3) documentation](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/v3/)

[Master / unstable (v4-pre) documentation](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/)

## Installation

`npm install sequelize`

From 3.0.0 and up Sequelize will follow [SEMVER](http://semver.org). 3.0.0 contains important security fixes so we highly recommend that users upgrade.

Starting from 4.0.0 Sequelize will only support Node v4 and above to use ES6 features.
