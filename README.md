## Partition Support

To enable partitioning in your Sequelize model, add a `partition` key to the model definition. In this example, we are using **range partitioning** based on the `created_at` column.

### Example
Add the following code to your Sequelize model file:

```js
const { Model, DataTypes } = require('sequelize');
const sequelize = require('../config/database'); // Update this path to match your config

class Event extends Model {}

Event.init({
  id: {
    type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
    primaryKey: true,
    autoIncrement: true,
  },
  name: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
  },
  created_at: {
    type: DataTypes.DATE,
    allowNull: false,
    primaryKey: true,
  }
}, {
  sequelize,
  modelName: 'Event',
  partition: {
    type: 'range',        // Partition type: RANGE
    column: 'created_at', // Partition based on 'created_at'
  },
  timestamps: false,      // Disable timestamps if not needed
});

module.exports = Event;
```
