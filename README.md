Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js/io.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, read replication and more.

[Documentation](http://sequelize.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

## Installation

`npm install sequelize`

From 3.0.0 and up Sequelize will follow SEMVER. 3.0.0 contains important security fixes so we highly recommend that users upgrade.

Starting from 4.0.0 Sequelize will only support Node v4 and above to use ES6 features. If you are still using older versions like 1.7 or 2.0, Please consider updating to latest v3.
