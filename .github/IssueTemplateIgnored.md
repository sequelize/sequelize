Sequelize requires you to [file new issues](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/new/choose) with specific [issue templates](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE). Please don't ignore our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#issues) and template structure. They help us quickly triage issues. Although we would like to help everyone, our time is finite.

Note that this issue will be closed for not following the issue template. You may open a new issue or update this one with correct template. You can add any additional information to your issue.
