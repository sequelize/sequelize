_Thanks for wanting to report an issue you've found in Sequelize. Please delete this text and fill in the template below. If unsure about something, just do as best as you're able._

_Note that it will be much easier for us to fix the issue if a test case that reproduces the problem is provided. Ideally this test case should not have any external dependencies. We understand that it is not always possible to reduce your code to a small test case, but we would appreciate to have as much data as possible. Thank you!_

_Github should only be used for feature requests and bugs - all questions belong on StackOverflow, Slack, or Google groups._
