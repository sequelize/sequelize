        Sequelize
        <small>A multi-dialect Object-Relational-Mapper for Node.JS</small>

      <p class="lead">
        The Sequelize library provides easy access to MySQL, SQLite, and PostgreSQL databases by mapping database entries to objects and vice versa. To put it in a nutshell... it's an ORM (Object-Relational-Mapper). The library is written entirely in JavaScript and can be used in the Node.JS environment.
