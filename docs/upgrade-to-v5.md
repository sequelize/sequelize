# Upgrade to v5

Sequelize v5 is the next major release after v4

## Breaking Changes

### Support for Node 6 and up

Sequelize v5 will only support Node 6 and up [#9015](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/9015)

### Secure Operators

With v4 you started to get a deprecation warning `String based operators are now deprecated`. Also concept of operators was introduced. These operators are Symbols which prevent hash injection attacks.

**With v5**

- Operators are now enabled by default.
- You can still use string operators by passing an operators map in `operatorsAliases`, but that will give you deprecation warning.
- Op.$raw is removed

### Model

**Attributes**

`Model.attributes` now removed, use `Model.rawAttributes`. [#5320](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/5320)

__Note__: _Please dont confuse this with `options.attributes`, they are still valid_

**Paranoid Mode**

With v5 if `deletedAt` is set, record will be considered as deleted. `paranoid` option will only use `deletedAt` as flag. [#8496](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/8496)

**Model.bulkCreate**

`updateOnDuplicate` option which used to accept boolean and array, now only accepts non-empty array of attributes. [#9288](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/9288)


**Underscored Mode**

Implementation of `Model.options.underscored` is changed. You can find full specifications [here](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/6423#issuecomment-379472035).

Main outline

1. Both `underscoredAll` and `underscored` options are merged into single `underscored` option
2. All attributes are now generated with camelcase naming by default. With the `underscored` option set to `true`, the `field` option for attributes will be set as underscored version of attribute name.
3. `underscored` will control all attributes including timestamps, version and foreign keys. It will not affect any attribute which already specifies the `field` option.
