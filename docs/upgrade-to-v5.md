# Upgrade to v5

Sequelize v5 is the next major release after v4

## Breaking Changes

### Support for Node 6 and up

Sequelize v5 will only support Node 6 and up [#9015](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/9015)

### Secure Operators

With v4 you started to get a deprecation warning `String based operators are now deprecated`. Also concept of operators was introduced. These operators are Symbols which prevent hash injection attacks.

[http://docs.sequelizejs.com/manual/querying.html#operators-security](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/manual/querying.html#operators-security)

**With v5**

- Operators are now enabled by default.
- You can still use string operators by passing an operators map in `operatorsAliases`, but that will give you deprecation warning.
- Op.$raw is removed

### Typescript Support

Sequelize now ship official typings [#10287](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/pull/10287). You can consider migrating away from external typings which may get out of sync.

### Pooling

With v5 Sequelize now use `sequelize-pool` which is a modernized fork of `generic-pool@2.5`. You no longer need to call `sequelize.close` to shutdown pool, this helps with lambda executions. [#8468](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/8468)

### Model

**Validators**

Custom validators defined per attribute (as opposed to the custom validators defined in the model's options) now run when the attribute's value is `null` and `allowNull` is `true` (while previously they didn't run and the validation succeeded immediately). To avoid problems when upgrading, please check all your custom validators defined per attribute, where `allowNull` is `true`, and make sure all these validators behave correctly when the value is `null`. See [#9143](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/9143).

**Attributes**

`Model.attributes` now removed, use `Model.rawAttributes`. [#5320](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/5320)

__Note__: _Please don't confuse this with `options.attributes`, they are still valid_

**Paranoid Mode**

With v5 if `deletedAt` is set, record will be considered as deleted. `paranoid` option will only use `deletedAt` as flag. [#8496](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/8496)

**Model.bulkCreate**

`updateOnDuplicate` option which used to accept boolean and array, now only accepts non-empty array of attributes. [#9288](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/9288)

**Underscored Mode**

Implementation of `Model.options.underscored` is changed. You can find full specifications [here](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/6423#issuecomment-379472035).

Main outline

1. Both `underscoredAll` and `underscored` options are merged into single `underscored` option
2. All attributes are now generated with camelcase naming by default. With the `underscored` option set to `true`, the `field` option for attributes will be set as underscored version of attribute name.
3. `underscored` will control all attributes including timestamps, version and foreign keys. It will not affect any attribute which already specifies the `field` option.

[#9304](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/pull/9304)

**Removed aliases**

Many model based aliases has been removed [#9372](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/9372)

| Removed in v5 | Official Alternative |
| :------ | :------ |
| insertOrUpdate | upsert |
| find | findOne |
| findAndCount | findAndCountAll |
| findOrInitialize | findOrBuild |
| updateAttributes | update |
| findById, findByPrimary | findByPk |
| all | findAll |
| hook | addHook |

### Datatypes

**Range**

Now supports only one standard format `[{ value: 1, inclusive: true }, { value: 20, inclusive: false }]` [#9364](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/pull/9364)

**Case insensitive text**

Added support for `CITEXT` for Postgres and SQLite

**Removed**

`NONE` type has been removed, use `VIRTUAL` instead

### Hooks

**Removed aliases**

Hooks aliases has been removed [#9372](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/9372)

| Removed in v5 | Official Alternative |
| :------ | :------ |
| [after,before]BulkDelete | [after,before]BulkDestroy |
| [after,before]Delete | [after,before]Destroy |
| beforeConnection | beforeConnect |

### Sequelize

**Removed aliases**

Prototype references for many constants, objects and classes has been removed [#9372](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/9372)

| Removed in v5 | Official Alternative |
| :------ | :------ |
| Sequelize.prototype.Utils | Sequelize.Utils |
| Sequelize.prototype.Promise | Sequelize.Promise |
| Sequelize.prototype.TableHints | Sequelize.TableHints |
| Sequelize.prototype.Op | Sequelize.Op |
| Sequelize.prototype.Transaction | Sequelize.Transaction |
| Sequelize.prototype.Model | Sequelize.Model |
| Sequelize.prototype.Deferrable | Sequelize.Deferrable |
| Sequelize.prototype.Error | Sequelize.Error |
| Sequelize.prototype[error] | Sequelize[error] |

```js
import Sequelize from 'sequelize';
const sequelize = new Sequelize('postgres://user:password@127.0.0.1:mydb');

/**
 * In v4 you can do this
 */
console.log(sequelize.Op === Sequelize.Op) // logs `true`
console.log(sequelize.UniqueConstraintError === Sequelize.UniqueConstraintError) // logs `true`

Model.findAll({
  where: {
    [sequelize.Op.and]: [ // Using sequelize.Op or Sequelize.Op interchangeably
      {
        name: "Abc"
      },
      {
        age: {
          [Sequelize.Op.gte]: 18
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}).catch(sequelize.ConnectionError, () => {
  console.error('Something wrong with connection?');
});

/**
 * In v5 aliases has been removed from Sequelize prototype
 * You should use Sequelize directly to access Op, Errors etc
 */

Model.findAll({
  where: {
    [Sequelize.Op.and]: [ // Don't use sequelize.Op, use Sequelize.Op instead
      {
        name: "Abc"
      },
      {
        age: {
          [Sequelize.Op.gte]: 18
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}).catch(Sequelize.ConnectionError, () => {
  console.error('Something wrong with connection?');
});
```

### Query Interface

- `changeColumn` no longer generates constraint with `_idx` suffix. Now Sequelize does not specify any name for constraints thus defaulting to database engine naming. This aligns behavior of `sync`, `createTable` and `changeColumn`.
- `addIndex` aliases options aliases have been removed, use the following instead.
  - `indexName` => `name`
  - `indicesType` => `type`
  - `indexType`/`method` => `using`

### Others

- Sequelize now use parameterized queries for all INSERT / UPDATE operations (except UPSERT). They provide better protection against SQL Injection attack.
- `ValidationErrorItem` now holds reference to original error in the `original` property, rather than the `__raw` property.
- [retry-as-promised](https://github.com/mickhansen/retry-as-promised) has been updated to `3.1.0`, which use [any-promise](https://github.com/kevinbeaty/any-promise). This module repeat all `sequelize.query` operations. You can configure `any-promise` to use `bluebird` for better performance on Node 4 or 6
- Sequelize will throw for all `undefined` keys in `where` options, In past versions `undefined` was converted to `null`.

### Dialect Specific

#### MSSQL

- Sequelize now works with `tedious >= 6.0.0`. Old `dialectOptions` has to be updated to match their new format. Please refer to tedious [documentation](http://tediousjs.github.io/tedious/api-connection.html#function_newConnection). An example of new `dialectOptions` is given below

```javascript
dialectOptions: {
  authentication: {
    domain: 'my-domain'
  },
  options: {
    requestTimeout: 60000,
    cryptoCredentialsDetails: {
      ciphers: "RC4-MD5"
    }
  }
}
```

#### MySQL

- Requires `mysql2 >= 1.5.2` for prepared statements

#### MariaDB

- `dialect: 'mariadb'` is now [supported](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/pull/10192) with `mariadb` package

### Packages

- removed: terraformer-wkt-parser [#9545](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/pull/9545)
