Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.

Sequelize follows [SEMVER](http://semver.org). Supports Node v6 and above to use ES6 features.

**Sequelize v5** was released on March 13, 2019. [Official TypeScript typings are now included](manual/typescript).

You are currently looking at the **Tutorials and Guides** for Sequelize. You might also be interested in the [API Reference](identifiers).

## Quick example

```js
const Sequelize = require('sequelize');
const sequelize = new Sequelize('postgres://user:pass@example.com:5432/dbname');

class User extends Sequelize.Model {}
User.init({
  username: Sequelize.STRING,
  birthday: Sequelize.DATE
}, { sequelize, modelName: 'user' });

sequelize.sync()
  .then(() => User.create({
    username: 'janedoe',
    birthday: new Date(1980, 6, 20)
  }))
  .then(jane => {
    console.log(jane.toJSON());
  });
```
