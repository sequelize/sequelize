# Documentation

The sequelize documentation is divided in two parts:

- Tutorials, guides, and example based documentation are written in Markdown
- The API reference is generated automatically from source code comments and types with [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/).

The tutorials, written in markdown, are located at the [website repository](https://github.com/sequelize/website).

To generate the API reference locally, run `yarn docs` and open the generated `.typedoc-build/index.html` in your favorite browser.

The whole documentation is rendered using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and continuously deployed to https://sequelize.org. See the [website repository](https://github.com/sequelize/website) for more information.
