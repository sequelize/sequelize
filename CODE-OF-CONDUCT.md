# Code of Conduct

All participants of Sequelize are expected to abide by our Code of Conduct,
both online (be it on GitHub, Slack, and others) and during in-person events (such as meetups) that are hosted and/or associated with Sequelize.

## The Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we pledge to make participation in our project
and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability,
ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion (or lack thereof), or sexual identity and orientation.

## The Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
- Referring to people by their preferred pronouns and using gender-neutral pronouns when uncertain.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Not being respectful to reasonable communication boundaries, such as 'leave me alone,' 'go away,' or 'I’m not discussing this with you.'.

- The use of disturbing language or imagery.

  gender identity and expression, nationality and race, skin color, personal appearance, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
- Other conduct which you know could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

We pledge to prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:
