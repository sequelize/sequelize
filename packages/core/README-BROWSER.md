This pull request is a casual attempt at "bunding" Sequelize for in-browser usage.

The original issue is:
https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/14654#issuecomment-1609794201

## Install

* Clone the repo: https://github.com/catamphetamine/sequelize/tree/feature/browser

* Run `yarn` in the root folder. It installs the packages.

* Go to the `core` package folder: `cd packages/core`.

* Run `npm run build` there. It creates a server-side build of Sequelize (core) and outputs it in the `lib` folder. The "entry" file is `lib/index.js`.

* Run `npm run build-browser` there. It creates a client-side "bundle" of Sequelize (core) from the server-side build in the `lib` folder, and outputs the results in the `bundle` folder. The file is `bundle/sequelize.min.js`.

* See the console output with the list of issues:

(!) Missing global variable names

Use "output.globals" to specify browser global variable names corresponding to external modules:
node:util (guessing "require$$0$1")
node:buffer (guessing "require$$0$2")
node:crypto (guessing "require$$0$3")
node:assert (guessing "require$$0$4")

* The Rollup config can be found at `packages/core/build/rollup.config.mjs`. It "shims" some of the server-side packages by replacing them with plaform-agnostic (pure-javascript) ones so that the code could run in a web browser environment.
