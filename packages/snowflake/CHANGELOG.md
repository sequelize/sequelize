### Bug Fixes

### Features

- re-add the ability to override the connector library ([#17219](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/17219)) ([b3c3362](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/commit/b3c3362aeca7ce50d0bdb657c6db25f2418dc687))
- type options per dialect, add "url" option, remove alternative Sequelize constructor signatures ([#17222](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/17222)) ([b605bb3](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/commit/b605bb372b1500a75daa46bb4c4ae6f4912094a1))

### BREAKING CHANGES

- `db2`, `ibmi`, `snowflake` and `sqlite` do not accept the `url` option anymore
- The sequelize constructor only accepts a single parameter: the option bag. All other signatures have been removed.
- Setting the sequelize option to a string representing a URL has been replaced with the `"url"` option.
- The `dialectOptions` option has been removed. All options that were previously in that object can now be set at the root of the option bag, like all other options.
- All dialect-specific options changed. This includes at least some credential options that changed.
- Which dialect-specific option can be used is allow-listed to ensure they do not break Sequelize
- The sequelize pool is not on the connection manager anymore. It is now directly on the sequelize instance and can be accessed via `sequelize.pool`
- The `sequelize.config` field has been removed. Everything related to connecting to the database has been normalized to `sequelize.options.replication.write` (always present) and `sequelize.options.replication.read` (only present if read-replication is enabled)
- `sequelize.options` is now fully frozen. It is no longer possible to modify the Sequelize options after the instance has been created.
- `sequelize.options` is a normalized list of option. If you wish to access the options that were used to create the sequelize instance, use `sequelize.rawOptions`
- The default sqlite database is not `':memory:'` anymore, but `sequelize.sqlite` in your current working directory.
- Setting the sqlite database to a temporary database like `':memory:'` or `''` requires configuring the pool to behave like a singleton, and disallowed read replication
- The `match` option is no longer supported by `sequelize.sync`. If you made use of this feature, let us know so we can design a better alternative.
- The `dialectModulePath` has been fully removed to improve compatibility with bundlers.
- The `dialectModule` option has been split into multiple options. Each option is named after the npm library that is being replaced. For instance, `@sequelize/postgres` now accepts `pgModule`. `@sequelize/mssql` now accepts `tediousModule`
